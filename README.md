Exercises
Getting Started
Create a Django project with one app, 'library'
Add views and templates for a home and books show page (/ and /books/<id>)
The home page will list all the book titles
The show page will list the chosen book title and author
Show a custom 404 if book is not found
Use dummy data for now:
[
    { 'id': 1, 'title': 'Life, the Universe and Everything', 'author': 'Douglas Adams'},
    { 'id': 2, 'title': 'The Meaning of Liff' 'author': 'Douglas Adams'},
    { 'id': 3, 'title': 'The No. 1 Ladies\' Detective Agency' 'author': 'Alexander McCall Smith'}
]
Add database and models

Setup a 'library' database (your choice of db)
Create models for Book and Author
Authors have a name
Books have a title and a Foreign Key for author
Make and run migrations
Add your models to your admin dashboard and create some records in the GUI
Update your views to take data from the database instead of the dummy data list
Add User authentication

Create register, login and logout routes
Use the UserCreationForm to complete your templates
Register some new users via your registration form
Make the book show route only available to logged in users
Add a new field of 'borrower' to the Book model as a Foreign Key to User
In your admin dashboard, assign some books a borrower
Update your book show template to show if it is available to loan or not
Add UI forms

Create a new book form accessible at books/new
On success, the form redirects to the new book's show page
Create a button on the book show page
If the book is available, on clicking the button, the current User becomes the borrower of that book
If the book is on loan by another User, current User sees disabled button
If the book is on loan by the current User, on clicking the button, the book is returned
